                <p>On February 16th, And it's already Friday, signaling the end of the workweek. The atmosphere felt
                    a bit more relaxed as most of the heavy tasks were behind us. I didn’t have much to do since we were
                    just finalizing the scanned thesis, making sure everything was properly checked and organized. It
                    was a day focused on quality control rather than quantity—carefully going over each scanned document
                    to ensure there were no errors or missed details. Though the workload was lighter, the importance of
                    precision was high, as we needed to guarantee the final product was up to standard. With the weekend
                    approaching, it was a good opportunity to reflect on the progress we made throughout the week,
                    knowing that our efforts had a direct impact on maintaining the integrity of these important
                    academic records. </p>

                <h3>Here are the tasks I completed today:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Finishing again the scanning thesis paper I left yesterday</li>
                    <li> I checked which thesis are already done scanned</li>
                    <li> I scanned new thesis which given to ask </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since I was still assigned in digitization that all I did today..</p>
